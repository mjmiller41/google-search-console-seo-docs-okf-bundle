# File types indexable by Google

> Mirrored from the official Google Search Central documentation at [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types). Page content, including any embedded figures, is authored by Google and was last updated by Google on 2026-02-03.[^google-indexable-file-types]

Google can index the content of most text-based files and certain encoded document formats. The file type is determined by the `Content-Type` HTTP header returned when Google crawls the file, though in some cases Google may use the file extension or re-parse the file using a different parser if the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect.

## Supported flat file types

The following flat file types are supported. These are files where the content is stored in plain, unencoded text (though they may use markup tags).

- Comma-Separated Values (.csv)
- Google Earth (.kml, .kmz)
- GPS eXchange Format (.gpx)
- HTML (.htm, .html, other file extensions)
- Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)
- TeX/LaTeX (.tex)
- Text (.txt, .text, other file extensions), including source code in common programming languages, such as:
  - Basic source code (.bas)
  - C/C++ source code (.c, .cc, .cpp, .cxx, .h, .hpp)
  - C# source code (.cs)
  - Java source code (.java)
  - Perl source code (.pl)
  - Python source code (.py)
- Wireless Markup Language (.wml, .wap)
- XML (.xml)

## Supported encoded file types

The following encoded file types are supported. These are binary files or complex containers that require a specific parser to extract the human-readable text.

- Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- Adobe PostScript (.ps)
- Electronic Publication (.epub)
- Hancom Hanword (.hwp)
- Microsoft Excel (.xls, .xlsx)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx)
- Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx)
- OpenOffice presentation (.odp)
- OpenOffice spreadsheet (.ods)
- OpenOffice text (.odt)
- Rich Text Format (.rtf)

## Supported media formats

Google can also index the following media formats:

- Image formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, and AVIF
- Video formats: 3GP, 3G2, ASF, AVI, DivX, M2V, M3U, M3U8, M4V, MKV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, OGV, QVT, RAM, RM, VOB, WebM, WMV, and XAP

## Search by file type

You can use the `filetype:` operator in Google Search to limit results to a specific file type or file extension. For example, [`filetype:rtf galway`](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype:rtf+galway) will search for RTF files and URLs ending in `.rtf` whose content contains the term "galway".
